# My BaseML Codebook

Here is a link to the BaseML page:

https://baseml.soilsrc.org

So to make a paragraph just seperate all of your typing with a blank line.

This is a new paragraph.

This is available from the [BaseML web page] (https://baseml.soilsrc.org).

Notice that hastags make a title.  This is a paragraph that has no line returns in it keeps going until there is a seperate line. 

This is a paragraph. Notice it is after a blank line.

Here comes another section with a level two heading.

## Formating

Use stars with no spaces for formatting.

*One star for italics.*

**Two stars for bold**

***Three stars for bold italics***

`Backtics to look like code.`

## Lists

Unordered lists use stars.

*Red
*Green
*Blue

Ordered list us `1. `:

1. Item
1. Item
1. Blah
1. Yet another Item

## Seperators

These are sometimes call horizontal rules. Just use four dashes `----`.

Here is something

----

Another Thing.

----

Blah.

----

Put a blank line between.

Just a plain link will be detected:

https://skilstak.io/

Or like this will be detected:

<https://skilstak.io>

You can also link email addresses:

<gavinvezendy@gmail.com>

Or you can be fancy and create hyper-linked text:

Here comes a [Link To Google] (https://google.com)
notice tge text is wrapped in square brackets. The line us wrapped in parentheses.

## Images

To embed an image just use the hyper-link syntax but put an exclamation point in front:

![Image of sunset on lake norman](./Sunset.jpg)

## Fences

Fences let us put other code into our document like JavaScript for example:

```js
console.log('hello)
```

Notice that you use three backticks. These are called *fence posts*

The first fence post can have a language after it.

You can leave off the language if you want.

```
    Roses are red,
    Violets are blue,
    You left your hairline at the zoo!
```


You can also use squiggle:

Something
